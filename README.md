# Activity-Recognition-CNN-LSTM

üöÄ Overview
This project focuses on realistic human activity recognition from video sequences using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture.

- CNN extracts spatial features from video frames.
- LSTM models the temporal dependencies across frames.
- Together, they enable robust recognition of dynamic human activities.

üß† Key Features
- End-to-end pipeline for activity recognition from raw video.
- Preprocessing pipeline to resize and normalize frames.
- Frame-level feature extraction using CNN.
- Sequence modeling using LSTM.
- High training accuracy with minimal overfitting (with dropout & regularization).
- Visualizations for training accuracy, loss, and predictions.
